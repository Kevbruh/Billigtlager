App til Billigtlager.dk

Description of the application and the motivation behind it
The application will be in cooperation with Billigtlager.dk, which is a storage firm that currently is located in Næstved on Zealand. Billigtlager is aiming to open another storage warehouse in Vordingborg during the year 2023. Therefore, they have asked us to create an interactive application that can update contemporary with the already operating webpage to satisfy the increasing customer demand.

The application must contain the same specifications and features as the webpage. However, it would be encouraged to add more features such as a button that can connect with the automatic door system that is installed in the warehouse for the customers to enter the warehouse and their storage room.

What works? 
The first view a user meet is a login screen that is connected to firebase. If a user has not got a profile, it is required to sign up. After signing the front page is presented with a scrollview. In the botton a navigation bar is presented with fragments. It is possible to navigate to:
•	Front page
•	Open door
•	See available rooms
•	Contact page
•	Customer page

The available room page almost succeeded. The app did get a database connection with room, but the storage room did not appear in one of the fragments. Also, the customer page is solely working as a log in screen. The payment method was not made. Therefore, it is not possible for customers to check-out yet. 
The above-listed requirements are all features that the web page currently provides to the customer. However, the possibility of executing orders and creating the payment method from the application will be the lowest-rated requirement. 
Extra features:
•	Changing division
